# Flights-Delay-Predivtive-Modeling-Python

All of us in the team are interested in traveling across the US during our spare time, like during the pacing break we went to several different places such as Seattle, Niagara Falls, and San Jos√©, etc. We believe a perfect starting will influence our entire trip, however, all of us have suffered from the flight delay or cancellation problems. This kind of terrible starting would definitely ruin our beautiful trips. 

Our objective is to dig deeper into the data and come up with a flight delay prediction model and some helpful suggestions, to make our future trips better (based on the Airline companies, locations, and time periods etc.).
